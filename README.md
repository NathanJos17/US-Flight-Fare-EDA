# US-Flight-Fare-EDA
EDA on US Flight Routes and Fare dataset that you can access from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/us-airline-flight-routes-and-fares-1993-2024. The aim for this EDA is to find some variable that made the flight fare go higher or lower.
General consensus might say that the amount of passengers, the amount of distance, or the place destination is the things that determined flight ticket fares. But from doing this analysis, i found even more things that made flight ticket fares go extremly up or even down. Though this dataset that i used only cover United State of America domestic flight, i do believe these findings can cover the general flight for other countries.
Some findings that i found : 
1. Past events that happend made flight ticket go low, 9/11 attack on 2001, Covid-19, are the two few influential events that made the prices go down
2. Airport choice's is important, some airport have higher price's because things like the amount of demand and lanes, airport policy, and airport type. Yes some commercial airport is expensive, but private airport, heliport, or amphibious airport do have higher price averages by 2 times.
3. City choice's, same with airport, some city have higher price's because of the demand, though cities that are considered holiday destination like Aspen, Jackson Wyoming, and Eagle have high fare. That happend because of the city's policy and the demand on holiday days.
4. Some days like holiday's obviously do increase ticket price, noticeable time of the year are summer break atleast for USA.
5. High distance doesn't really mean high prices, but routes that have the amount of distance more than 1500 miles does typically have high fares for the ticket.
6. High distance ticket prices are more likely have more efficients ticket fares/miles.

This analysis are far from perfection, i am very open for critics and opinion. You can contact me trough IG : @mr.yi_tan and my linkedin : https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-joshua-61b96b141/
